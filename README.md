ASL Student Templates
=====================

This repository is meant to orient the students who conduct a project (Studies on Mechatronics, Bachelor-, Semester-, and Master Theses) at the Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) at ETH Zurich. It contains general information, guidelines, templates  and helpful links.

This document is organized as follows:

* Downloads
* Organisation
* Literature management
* Presentations
* Report
* Plagiarism
* Evaluation

## Downloads

You can download the templates for the coordination report, the final report, and the final presentation from this repository directly as a ZIP-file [here](https://github.com/ethz-asl/asl-student-templates/archive/master.zip).

## Organisation

Bachelor and Semester projects last 14 weeks starting at the first day of the semester and end at the end of the semester. Master projects last 6 months and the starting date is agreed on with the supervisor.

Please provide your supervisor a work schedule **within two weeks** after the start of the project.

You will agree with your supervisor on a weekly meeting. The meeting is meant to answer your questions and to check your progress. It is helpful for you to prepare these meetings with the coordination sheet provided in this repository in ``Coordination report/``.

## Literature Management

Scientific publications can be found on websites such as

- [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.ch),
- [IEEE Xplore](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/),
- [Springer Link](http://link.springer.com),
- [NEBIS](http://www.nebis.ch),
- [ETH-Bilbiothek](http://www.library.ethz.ch/).

Make sure to access these website from within the ETH network or use VPN. This gives you access to download full PDF files from many publishers.

Use the bibliographies and the *cited by* functions to find related publications.

For the organization of your references, we recommend to use [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com), a free and cross-platform reference management software. As a handy feature, Mendeley can automatically build your BibTeX files. Make sure to follow [these instructions](http://www.library.ethz.ch/en/Dienstleistungen/Publizieren-registrieren-verwalten/Mendeley-Institutional-Edition) to access additional features.

## Presentations

An informal _intermediate presentation_ (about 10 minutes presentation/discussion) about your work will take place around mid-term. The goal of the presentation is to give a brief summary of the work done, to propose a plan for the continuation of the project, and to discuss about the main directions of the project.

The _final presentation_ will take place at the end of the project. A test run is presented to and discussed with the supervisors 2â€“5 days before the public final presentation.

Exact dates and times for the intermediate and final presentations will be arranged by the lab administration.

The durations of the final presentations are

- Bachelor and Semester projects: 15 minutes presentation, 5 minutes questions / discussion,
- Semester/Bachelor Project with integrated SoM: 22 minutes presentation, 8 minutes questions / discussion,
- Master projects: 20 minutes presentation, 10 minutes questions / discussion,
- Studies on Mechatronics (SoM): 10 minutes presentation, 5 minutes questions / discussion.

The presentation is evaluated based on the final public presentation.

For the slides, we recommend to use the template as it is provided in this repository  in ``Presentation/``. Further information on the ETH Zurich templates is given [here](https://www1.ethz.ch/hk/docs/corporate_design/buero).

## Report

A report has to be handed in to the responsible supervisor. The report has to describe the full work performed during the entire project. A preliminary version has to be handed in **one week after the final presentation** or as determined with the supervisor. The preliminary version of the report is discussed with the supervisor. The final report has to be handed over to the responsible supervisor in **three paper copies**. All documents and files, including the report (original data and as a PDF-file) and the final presentation, have to be saved on a CD/DVD and handed in together with the final report.

The report is evaluated based on the preliminary version with the requirement that the remarks are incorporated in the final report.

We recommend to use the LaTeX template as it is provided in this repository in ``Report/``. Information on the usage of LaTeX is given in ``Manuals/The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX 2E.pdf``. Also, make sure to be familiar with the style guide described in ``Manuals/LaTeX Style Guide.pdf``.

## Plagiarism

Every student has to make himself/herself familiar with the [ETH Zurich rules regarding plagiarism](http://www.ethz.ch/faculty/exams/plagiarism/index_EN).

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated according to the ASL evaluation sheet. For Bachelor, Semester, and Master Theses, the grade consists of

- **40%** General (Commitment, Methodology, Autonomy, Theory etc.),
- **20%** Implementation,
- **20%** Report,
- **20%** Presentation .

For Studies on Mechatronics the grade consists of

- **40%** General (Commitment, Methodology, Autonomy, Theory etc.),
- **30%** Report,
- **30%** Presentation.
